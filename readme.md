# storybook-addon-mantine

Addon for storybook which wraps Mantine components with a MantineProvider. Allows you to switch between themes and see how your components and pages will look

Thank you to the creators of [storybook-addon-material-ui](https://github.com/react-theming/storybook-addon-material-ui) - your project demonstrated how to connect the panel with the preview wrapper.
